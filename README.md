For NASA Space Apps Challenge 2022 - Visualizing the Jovian System Like Never Before

The main prototype deliverable will be the Jupyter Notebook [here](https://github.com/ejgl/uw_junocam/blob/main/NASA_Space_Challenge.ipynb) - in this file the main functions (querying for JunoCam data, displaying orbital path metadata, and image processing) are demonstrated or shown in a proof of concept.

For a quick guide on how to get started on the web-app, check out the wiki [here](https://github.com/ejgl/uw_junocam/wiki).
